Task 2
STEP 1: Create an array variable myArray
STEP 2: Input unsorted values into the myArray variable
STEP 3: Create a nested loop
       i. The Outer loop starts iterating from the first index of the myArray.
       ii. The inner loop checks if the previous value is greater than the current value.
       iii. As long as the condition above remains true we want to swap the current value with the previous value 
       and we also want to update the current value in the inner loop so we can compare that value with other 
       elements at index postion that is greater than or equal to zero.
       iv. If the updated current value remains less than the previous value, Repeat step 3iii.
STEP 4: Exit the loop
STEP 5: Print out the value of myArray.
